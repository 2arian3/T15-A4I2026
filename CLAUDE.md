# Coding Agent Guide

## Prerequisites

Install the CLI (one-time):
```bash
uv tool install google-agents-cli
```

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements
Before writing any code, understand the project's requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

### Phase 2: Build and Implement
Implement agent logic in `agent/`. Use `agents-cli playground` for interactive testing. Iterate based on user feedback.

### Phase 3: The Evaluation Loop (Main Iteration Phase)
Start with 1-2 eval cases, run `agents-cli eval run`, iterate by making changes and rerunning it until satisfied. Expect 5-10+ iterations. Once you have a baseline, reach for `agents-cli eval compare` (regression diffs), `agents-cli eval analyze` (cluster failure modes), and `agents-cli eval optimize` (auto-tune prompts). See the **Evaluation Guide** for metrics, dataset schema, LLM-as-judge config, and common gotchas.

### Phase 4: Pre-Deployment Tests
Run `uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration`. Fix issues until all tests pass.

### Phase 5: Deploy to Dev
**Requires explicit human approval.** Run `agents-cli deploy` only after user confirms. See the **Deployment Guide** for details.

### Phase 6: Production Deployment
Ask the user: Option A (simple single-project) or Option B (full CI/CD pipeline with `agents-cli infra cicd`).

## This repo: use the Makefile

Deploys and teardown go through the `Makefile`, which pins the project
(`qwiklabs-gcp-04-e3eaf2b4f0c3`), region (`us-central1`), model location (`global`)
and the runtime service account (`curbside-agent@...`). Prefer `make <target>` over
calling `agents-cli deploy` directly, so the service account is never dropped.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make web` / `make serve` | ADK web UI locally / the deployed server locally |
| `make test` | Unit tests (no credentials needed); also runs before every deploy |
| `make setup` | APIs, service account and roles (`scripts/setup_sa.sh`) |
| `make deploy` / `make status` | Deploy or update the agent on Agent Runtime |
| `make destroy` / `make destroy-sa` | Delete the agent / the service account |

New IAM roles for the agent go in `PROJECT_ROLES` in both `scripts/setup_sa.sh`
and `scripts/destroy_sa.sh`, and in `EXPECTED_PROJECT_ROLES` in
`tests/unit/test_scripts_and_makefile.py`.

## Development Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `agents-cli playground` | Interactive local testing |
| `uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration` | Run unit and integration tests |
| `agents-cli eval dataset synthesize` | Synthesize multi-turn eval scenarios for your agent |
| `agents-cli eval run` | Run the agent over the eval dataset and grade the traces |
| `agents-cli eval generate` / `agents-cli eval grade` | Decoupled form: produce traces, then grade them |
| `agents-cli eval compare` | Compare two grade-results files (regression check) |
| `agents-cli eval analyze` | Cluster failure modes from grade results |
| `agents-cli eval metric list` | List built-in metrics available in the SDK |
| `agents-cli eval optimize` | Auto-tune agent prompts using eval data |
| `agents-cli lint` | Check code quality |
| `agents-cli deploy` | Deploy to dev |
| `agents-cli scaffold enhance` | Add deployment target or CI/CD to project |
| `agents-cli scaffold upgrade` | Upgrade project to latest version |

## Operational Guidelines for Coding Agents

- **Code preservation**: Only modify code directly targeted by the user's request. Preserve all surrounding code, config values (e.g., `model`), comments, and formatting.
- **NEVER change the model** unless explicitly asked.
- **Model 404 errors**: Fix `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` (e.g., `global` instead of `us-central1`), not the model name.
- **ADK tool imports**: Import the tool instance, not the module: `from google.adk.tools.load_web_page import load_web_page`
- **Run Python with `uv`**: `uv run python script.py`. Run `agents-cli install` first.
- **Stop on repeated errors**: If the same error appears 3+ times, fix the root cause instead of retrying.
- **Terraform conflicts** (Error 409): Use `terraform import` instead of retrying creation.
